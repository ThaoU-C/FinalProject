        <span><i>“The California coast without kelp is like the Amazon without trees,”</i></span> <br>states by Tom Ford, an executive director of the <a class="website" href="https://www.santamonicabay.org/"> Bay Foundation.</a> <br> <br>
        The kelp forest ecosystem along the coast of California provides many benefits. It absorbs CO2 and
        reduces the acidification of the ocean that would be a threat to marine life. Through photosynthesis,
        kelp increase the oxygen levels in the ocean and control erosion by reducing the speed and size of waves
        impacting the shore. Kelp can also be used as a source of biofuel. Lastly, around 800 species of marine
        life depend on the kelp forest to survive. Marine mammals use kelp forests not only as feeding grounds but also as places to hide from their predators.
        <br>
        However, kelp forests are dying. A heat wave between 2014 and 2016 killed off <b>90%</b> of kelp living along
        the northern California coast. And, in southern California, kelp has already been reduced by 75% in some
        areas. Because overfishing and pollution reduced the predators and competitors of the purple sea
        urchin, its population has exploded and consumed vast tracts of kelp forests, leaving a barren seascape
        in their wake.

            Sea Otter
          </h3>
         <p>Southern sea otters live along California’s central coast, from San Mateo County to Santa Barbara. The
          sea otter is a keystone species since its health is an indicator of the overall health of the habitat and
          environment. Sea otters help maintain the health of kelp forests by eating sea urchins and controlling
          their population and preventing the emergence of urchin barrens, which are areas devoid of any kelp.
          The fur coat of sea otters is the densest in the world, made up of more than 1 million hairs per square
          inch, compared to just 100,000 hairs per square inch that people have.
          <br>
          <br>
          Sea otters has been listed as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act since 1977.
          The California population averages around only <a class="website" href="https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/animals-a-to-z/sea-otter">3,000 individuals.</a></p>

             <p>Harbor seals are one of the most common marine mammals along the U.S. West and East Coasts. They weigh up to 285 pounds and measure up to 6 feet in length.  They are protected under the <a class="website" href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/laws-policies/marine-mammal-protection-act"> Marine Mammal Protection Act.</a> They have short forelimbs, or flippers. They also lack external ear flaps and instead have a small hole on either side of their head.<br><br>
              <a class="website" href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/harbor-seal">Harbor seals are facing Habitat Degradation.</a> Oil and gas development, commercial and recreational development (including resort development), and increased vessel traffic may displace seals or their prey that would normally use those areas. They accumulate contaminants, which threaten their immune and reproductive systems, in their blubber, blood, and organs.

         <p>Sea cows used to live along the coast of California and became extinct in the 18th Century, just 27 years
          after first being discovered by Europeans. Scientists theorize that sea cows would have kept kelp forests
          healthy by grazing kelp at the surface and allowing sunlight to reach deeper into the water and allow
          algae to grow and become a food source for sea urchins. What would sea cows look like today if they

                Sea Lion
              </h3>
             <p>Sea lion habitat range from southeast Alaska to central Mexico. The sea lion population is considered
              least concerned since it is estimated to be up to <a class="website" href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/species/zalophus-californianus-californianus">300,000 individuals.</a> 
              <br>
              <br>However, sea lions are affected by
              climate change since warm waters can reduce plant abundance, which will affect the population of the
              prey that they consume and cascade up to higher levels in the food chain where sea lions reside.
              Warming waters can also cause <a class="website" href="https://www.kazu.org/local/2020-06-23/an-annual-sea-lion-sickness-is-linked-to-climate-change">algal blooms,</a> which produce a toxin known as domoic acid and can
              attack the brain, causing seizures and disorientation. This toxin will accumulate in fish and other marine
              animals that consume algae. Eventually, the toxin will reach sea lions when they prey on marine animals.</p>
