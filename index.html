        <header>
          <h1> California kelp forests, a habitat for more than 800 marine spieces, are dying because of climate change </h1>
       </header>
       <p>
        <span>“The California coast without kelp is like the Amazon without trees,”</span> Tom Ford, executive director of the <a class="website" href="https://www.santamonicabay.org/"> Bay Foundation</a>, states the importance of kelp forests to California marine environment. <br> <br>
        Kelp forests don’t just play a fundamental role in curbing climate change. Sea otters and some 800 other marine species depend on them, as do fishers in the state’s abalone and red urchin industries, now devastated by a purple urchin population explosion. Gray whales shelter their young in kelp forests. The algae can also be used as biofuel, and when fed to cows dramatically cuts planet-warming methane emissions from their burps. In California, kelp forests shape waves by absorbing some of their energy to produce optimal conditions for surfing, a multimillion-dollar business.</p>
